# Password Generator Starter Code
This is a website that can generate secure passwords.
It takes parameters such as length and character types and creates a password that fills all of the user's criteria.
It was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
There are some small improvements that can be made, like fixing the issue where the first 4 characters of any password will always be:

- 1 lowercase letter
- 1 uppercase letter
- 1 number 
- 1 special character
(in this specific order)

For longer passwords this is not an issue, but for short 8 character passwords it could make the password slightly less secure.
The benefit is that the password will always fit the user's criteria, but it has to come with this compromise for now.
